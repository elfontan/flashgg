# AnalysisTools

This repository contains most of the analysis code used in the context of HIG-24-014. 
The details of the content of each subdirectory are mentioned in the following:

   - `GenLevel`: basic code for studies at generator level
   - `ParametricNN`: procedure to prepare the inputs and perform the training and the validation of the PNN
   - `SignalStudies`: set of scripts for signal MC studies and for splitting events in different categories 
   - `Systematics`: set of scripts for studying contribution of systematic uncertainties and for splitting events in different categories also for the alternative trees for systematics
   - `LimitEstimates`: plotting scripts for limits and guidance for LikelihoodScans and Impacts studies 

Note 1: the code for Zee validation can be found in a separate github area ([ZeeValidation](https://github.com/elfontan/ZeeValidation)).

Note 2: the signal and background modelling is based on [flashggFinalFit](https://github.com/elfontan/flashggFinalFit/tree/EF_lowMassAnalysis)).
